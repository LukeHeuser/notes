# What is Spring?

Spring is a *Java Framework* that makes it easy to create Java Enterprise Applications.

The Spring Framework is divided into modules. At the center are the modules of the core container, including a `configuration model` and a `dependency injection mechanism`.

The `Spring Framework` provides foundational support for different application architectures, including `messaging`, `transactional data and persistence`, and `web`. It also includes the Servlet-based Spring MVC web framework and, in parallel, the Spring WebFlux reactive web framework.

A note about modules: Spring Framework’s jars allow for deployment to the module path (Java Module System). For use in module-enabled applications, the Spring Framework jars come with `Automatic-Module-Name` manifest entries which define stable language-level module names (`spring.core`, `spring.context`, etc.) independent from jar artifact names. The jars follow the same naming pattern with `-` instead of `.` – for example, `spring-core` and `spring-context`. Of course, Spring Framework’s jars also work fine on the classpath.

* `Spring Framework 6.0` is fully compatible with `Tomcat 10.1`, `Jetty 11` and `Undertow 2.3` as `web servers`, and also with `Hibernate ORM 6.1`

Today, with the help of Spring Boot, applications are created in a devops- and cloud-friendly way, with the Servlet container embedded and trivial to change. 


## Why Spring?

Spring provides the most important features needed to build easily maintanable applications: `Dependency Injection` & `Autowiring`.

Spring Boot Makes using the Spring Frame work *MUCH* easier.
