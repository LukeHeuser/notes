# What is Java?
* Java is a simple and secure, `OOP` programming language.
* Because of it's `Archetecturally Neutral` behavaior, it has no implemntation dependent features. In other words, the programme doesn't compile into machine code native to the OS.
* Robust and Secure:
    * Everything is `Sandboxed`

## Java Compiler
`Compile Time Checking`: `Source Code` is taken and turned into `Bytecode` that the `Java Virtual Machine` `(JVM)` can understand.

The Compiler searches the entire `Source Code` first searching for syntax and other errors. If found, errors will be displayed. If  no errors are found, the `Source Code` will be converted into the `Machine Code` that will be executed. 

* The Compiler bgins by searching for syntax errors
* This also serves as Javas error detection system
* This is what allows Java to be ran no matter the OS

## Java Interpreter
