# Java Fundabentals & Basics


## Expressions
An `expression` is a coding contruct made up of variables, operators, & method invocations that equate to a single value. The expression is the code segment found on the right side of the equals sign in an assignment or decleration statement.

A `literal` is the SIMPLIST form of an expression. It can not be changed like a variable. 

## Statements
What is a statement? Java statements are fundamental building blocks in Java. A `statement` in Java is an instruction; a command for the programming language to execute. Statements can be simple or compound. There are three types of statements in Java.

### Expression Statement
An `expression statement` is a statement that includes one or more expressions. They can change values of variables, call methods, and create objects.

While all expression statements are statements; not all statements can be an expression. This is because expressions can be assigned and used as operands, while statements can only be decalred.

EX.
~~~
int myFirstNumber = ((10 + 5) * (2 + 4))
~~~
This line of code has three expressions, 
1. (10 + 5)
2. (2  + 4)
3. (15 * 8) What is assigned to myFirstNumber


### Decleration Statment
A Decleration Statment is used to declare/ define a variable by indicating the `Data Type` & `Name`. Optionally to set to a specific value.

EX.
~~~
int myFirstNumber = 25;
~~~
The data type is delcared, a name is given to the variable so it may be accessed later in memory and a value has been set.  However, it is not required.

### Control-Flow Statements
Control-Flow Statements determine the order that statements are executed.
