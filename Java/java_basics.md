# Java Basics


## Expressions
An `expression` is a coding contruct made up of variables, operators, & method invocations that equate to the a single value. As seen on the right side of an equals.

A `literal` is the SIMPLIST form of an expression. It can not be changed like a variable. 


## Statements
What is a statement? A `statement` in Java is an instruction.. A command for the programming language to execute. There are three types of statements in Java.

### Expression Statement
An expression statemtent can include one or more expressions.
While all expression statements are statements; not all statements are expression statments.

EX.
~~~
int myFirstnumer = ((10 + 5) * (2 + 4))
~~~
This line of code has three expressions, 
1. (10 + 5)
2. (2  + 4)
3. (15 * 8)


### Decleration Statment
A Decleration Statment is used to define a variable by indicating the `Data Type` & `Name`. Optionally to set to a specific value.

EX.
~~~
int myFirstNumber = 25;
~~~
The data type is delcared, a name is given to the variable so it may be accessed later in memory and a value has been set.  However, it is not required.
