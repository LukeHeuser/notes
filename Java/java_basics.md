# Java Fundabentals & Basics


## Expressions
An `expression` is a coding contruct made up of variables, operators, & method invocations that equate to a single value. The expression is the code segment found on the right side of the equals sign in an assignment or decleration statement.

A `literal` is the SIMPLIST form of an expression. It can not be changed like a variable. 

## Statements
What is a statement? Java statements are fundamental building blocks in Java. A `statement` in Java is an instruction; a command for the programming language to execute. Statements can be simple or compound. There are three types of statements in Java.

Simply put, a `statement` is any instruction given to the programming language to execute. "carrying out actions."

### Expression Statement
An `expression statement` is a statement that includes one or more expressions. They can change values of `variables`, `call methods`, and `create objects`.

While all expression statements are statements; not all statements can be an expression. This is because expressions can be assigned and used as operands, while statements can only be declared.

EX.
~~~
int myFirstNumber = ((10 + 5) * (2 + 4))
~~~
This line of code has three expressions:
1. (10 + 5)
2. (2 + 4)
3. (15 * 8) What is assigned to myFirstNumber

### Decleration Statment
A Decleration Statment is used to declare/ define a variable by indicating the `Data Type` & `Name`. Optionally to set to a specific value.

EX.
~~~
int myFirstNumber;
// OR
int myFirstNumber = 25;
~~~
The data type is delcared and a name is given to the variable so it may be accessed later in memory and a value has been set.  However, it is not required to set a value.

FOR REFERENCE: the value of `25` in the code above is an expression. 

### Control-Flow Statements
`Control Flow Statements` determine the order that statements are executed. A great example of a `Contorl Flow Statement` is an if/else statement. 

## Variables
A `Variable` needs a data type & name to be stored in the RAM. An expression is used to assign a single value to the variable. Variables are, as the name suggests, variable. Meaning, their value can change.

Behind the scence: Java has allocated a place in memory to store the information and set up a mechanism to allow access of the location through the given name. 

* A variable needs an expression to initialize a value
* A variable can only be delcared once, but can be initialized many times changing the value
* There are 8 Primitive data types that a variable can be assigned

## Operators
`Operatores` perforam an operation on a variable or value.

An Example is addition, subtraction, division, & multiplication.
